**[Live Demo](http://ghazale.co.nf/index.php/inquiry-calc-live-demo/)**

**Online Cost Inquiry System**

Perfect for user inquiries about the cost of service or product. Very lightweight. Calculates the final cost immediately in real time based on the fees you have set in the options. It emails the final cost/cost-breakdown to user upon request. And it also updates admin about new inquiries as well. Admin can see what inquiries have been made and also can see what the user has selected and what the cost structure has been when the user used the inquiry calculator on your website.

This is particularly useful when there are common inquiry questions about the cost of a customized product or an online service. So the users can immediately and automatically get their answer with no waiting time.

This plugin also includes the following features:

* Ability to add conditional or unconditional questions

* Add unlimited inquiry questions and their related conditions.

* Add separate costs for each question or condition

* Edit or Delete the questions that you have already added

* Use a custom currency of your choice

* The option to have/ or not to have a minimum cost.

* Custom Thank you page redirection

* Option to inform admin if the user requested to receive the cost-breakdown by email.

* Admin will see the exact cost structure that the user has seen when he/she used the online inquiry system

* If the user chooses to receive the cost break-down by email, they will receive it in a nicely structured table in their email.

* The plugin adds the cost in real-time (with no page refresh) when the user answers "Yes/No" to any of the questions.

* For the conditional questions; the conditions would only appear if the user answers "Yes" to the parent question, otherwise it won't show at all, so the user doesn't get confused.

* Ability to slide back and forth between the inquiry questions and change the answers.

* When the answers change, the total cost also gets updated accordingly in real-time.

* After you set up your settings and added your questions/conditions with their costs, just put the shortcode **[inquiry-calc]** on any post or page and you're ready to go.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= There's "Minimum Flat Cost" field in the settings. I don't want minimum cost in my usage of this plugin. What should I do? =

If you don't have a minimum cost, just leave its field blank. It automatically disappears on the frontend and it also automatically excluded from the calculations.

= Why the Thank You page redirection doesn't work/ gives error? =

Based on your server settings, sometimes you need to include the "http" at the first of the url to make it work. Also make sure you have put the right URL in the page redirection field in the settings.
